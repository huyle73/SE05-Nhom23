We do not provide that type of solution
No Mr. Korsian

What kind of solution do you want, Mr. Korsian?

Hi there!
Are you able to create a solution that we require?
Thanks
We use AIR for desktop and WASM for web
One question - what coding language do you using?
Terrain modeling is represented in planner5d as usual slab with green loan surface on top
Multilevel - yes
Town house - yes
Terrains - no
We as architects using bim tools as revit and Archicad.
In planner5d you are able to add more levels. We do not need to create the real terrains - it’s hard work for usual amateurs.
You need a software for both two types: apartments and townhouse?
If for the apartments only, things is much easier because we dont have to create the landscape, and currently both our House3D and the Planner5D is suitable for doing that. But if you have to use it to modelling the townhouse with multi-level then it is much difficult and curently Planner5D or House3D is not suitable (you have to use something like Sketchup)
yes
You want to use that software for apartments or town house?
something like this https://planner5d.com
I understand, it may be point of our future interest but now we need the tool for house modeling
each building in Vietnam often has 10 to 15 significant floor plan. Base on 1 floor plan we prepare 1 to 5 interior design concepts. The real-estate salesman use these rendered concepts as a marketing tool to boost the sales orders. After the home owner bought his house (without furniture), he can continue to modify the concept he likes, by using some very simple interactions like: replace the sofa, change the tile, the wall paper, lamp... and then they can connect to the suppliers via our House3D to buy all things
and show to the customer the total price of his house
and then our software will convert is according to our pricelist
etc
doors list
windows list
total slab area
